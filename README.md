# Part 1: RAG Model for QA Bot
This section outlines the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a Question Answering (QA) bot. The bot retrieves relevant information from documents and generates coherent answers using a vector database (Pinecone) and a generative model (Cohere API).

## Features
Document Retrieval: Retrieve relevant information from a dataset based on user queries.
Coherent Answer Generation: Use the Cohere API to generate answers based on retrieved context.

## Technologies
Python: Programming language for implementation.
Pinecone: Vector database for efficient document storage and retrieval.
Cohere API: NLP model for generating answers.
SentenceTransformers: For embedding document text and user queries.

## Setup Instructions
### Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qa-bot.git
cd qa-bot

### Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  

### Install Dependencies: Ensure requirements.txt is in your repository. Run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the Code: Execute the script that implements the RAG model.
Test Queries: Use several test queries to evaluate the model's performance.
